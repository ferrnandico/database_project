# Database Project - E-commerce

This is a simple database project for an e-commerce system. The database schema has been created using SQL and includes tables to manage customers, products, orders, suppliers, and other aspects related to e-commerce.

## Database Schema

The database schema consists of the following tables:

- `customer`: Stores customer information.
- `product`: Contains details of available products.
- `product_review`: Records product ratings and reviews.
- `orders`: Keeps a record of customer orders.
- `product_storage`: Manages product inventory.
- `supplier`: Stores supplier information.
- `seller`: Maintains details of sellers.
- `product_seller`: Associates products with sellers.
- `product_supplier`: Links products with suppliers.
- `product_orders`: Relates products to orders.
- `storage_location`: Maps product storage locations.
- `payment`: Records payment details.

## Notes

- The project is a simplified simulation and may not cover all aspects of a real-world e-commerce system.
